# I unfortunately don't have the time anymore to play and update my mods. If anyone wants to update/change the mod. Feel free to do that. :)


# Description
 

This Mod adds functional storage versions for some props from [Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Props and Decor](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2102143149). It uses the storage system from [Deep Storage](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1617282896).

I did not touch the original decorative versions, you can still build them normally. The new ones can be found in the Storage Tab from Deep Storage.

Please put the Mod <ins>after</ins> VFE - Props and Deep Storage in your Load Order.


# Compatibility


A Patch for [Thermodynamics - Hot Meals](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2110968173) is included:
 - When the Mod is active it will add a seperate powered Version of the Microwave and Oven.
